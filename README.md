# Multi-Base Numerical Converter

This was an assignment for my Discrete Mathematics in Computer Programming class. 

<ins>Objective</ins>: Create a program that converts numbers between different numerical representations. The program should handle conversions between any bases from 2 to 16. The user will input a number, specify its base, and the base to which it should be converted.

I decided to write in Java, since it had been a while since I wrote in Java and probably feel most comfotable within it once I get my stride going. 

<ins>To run</ins>: Open the folder containing the file within your IDE and it should run fairly easily.
